<h1>Public Health Analysis: Obesity, Physical Activity, and Nutrition Trends among Adults in the United States</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> 
This data visualization project provides a comprehensive analysis of public health trends among adults in the United States, focusing specifically on three critical behavioural factors: nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. Using data sourced from the CDCâ€™s Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the project explores how these factors vary across demographics such as age, race, sex, income level, and geographic location.

The dashboards were designed in Tableau to not only present raw percentages and trends but also to highlight disparities through Z-score standardization, enabling meaningful comparisons across states and over time. By normalizing the data, viewers can identify which states or groups are performing significantly above or below the national average, facilitating targeted public health strategies.

The interactive nature of the dashboards allows users to explore relationships between lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes in depth. For example, users can investigate how physical activity trends differ by income group, or how obesity rates correlate with race and age across different states. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to support evidence-based decision-making for public health officials. The project aims to drive awareness and encourage the development of interventions tailored to high-risk populations and underperforming regions. As a note, this was a group project created by Nikki Shimao, Simran Gandhi, Shreya Ojha, Spoorthi Reddy, and Shreshth Shetty.<p>

<h2>Project Walk-Through</h2>

<h3>1) Cover Page</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Public Health Analysis: Obesity, Physical Activity, and Nutrition Trends among Adults in the U.S.

<strong>Summary</strong>: This introductory slide outlines the five core areas of analysis explored in the Tableau dashboard suite:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Obesity and Overweight Trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Physical Activity Trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Inactivity Trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fruit & Vegetable Consumption</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Final Insights</strong></li>
</ol>

<p> The visual theme emphasizes the relationship between health behaviours and lifestyle choices, setting the stage for deeper insights throughout the dashboards. It orients viewers to expect an analysis segmented by state, income, age, sex, and race.
