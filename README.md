<h1>Public Health Analysis: Obesity, Physical Activity, and Nutrition Trends among Adults in the United States</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> 
This data visualization project provides a comprehensive analysis of public health trends among adults in the United States, focusing specifically on three critical behavioural factors: nutrition, physical activity, and obesity. Using data sourced from the CDC’s Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the project explores how these factors vary across demographics such as age, race, sex, income level, and geographic location.

The dashboards were designed in Tableau to not only present raw percentages and trends but also to highlight disparities through Z-score standardization, enabling meaningful comparisons across states and over time. By normalizing the data, viewers can identify which states or groups are performing significantly above or below the national average, facilitating targeted public health strategies.

The interactive nature of the dashboards allows users to explore relationships between lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes in depth. For example, users can investigate how physical activity trends differ by income group, or how obesity rates correlate with race and age across different states. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to support evidence-based decision-making for public health officials. The project aims to drive awareness and encourage the development of interventions tailored to high-risk populations and underperforming regions. As a note, this was a group project created by Nikki Shimao, Simran Gandhi, Shreya Ojha, Spoorthi Reddy, and Shreshth Shetty.<p>

<h2>Project Walk-Through</h2>

<h3>1) Cover Page</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Public Health Analysis: Obesity, Physical Activity, and Nutrition Trends among Adults in the U.S.

<strong>Summary</strong>: This introductory slide outlines the five core areas of analysis explored in the Tableau dashboard suite:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Obesity and Overweight Trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Physical Activity Trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Inactivity Trends</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fruit & Vegetable Consumption</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Final Insights</strong></li>
</ol>

<p> The visual theme emphasizes the relationship between health behaviours and lifestyle choices, setting the stage for deeper insights throughout the dashboards. It orients viewers to expect an analysis segmented by state, income, age, sex, and race.

<h3>2) Obesity and Overweight Trends Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Obesity and Overweight Trends among Adults in the U.S.

<strong>Summary</strong>: This dashboard analyzes how obesity rates and overweight prevalence vary across states and demographic groups using standardized Z- scores.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The map shows the geographic distribution of obesity rates across 13 years.</li>
  <li>Z-score trends track state deviations from the national average over 13 years.</li>
  <li>Additional views break down trends by age, sex, and race, helping to identify which population groups are most at risk.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Key Insight</strong>: States like Pennsylvania and demographic groups such as older adults and certain racial minorities show disproportionately high obesity or overweight rates, emphasizing where public health interventions may be needed most.

</p>

<h3>3) Physical Activity Trends Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Physical Activity Trends among Adults in the U.S.

<strong>Summary</strong>: This dashboard focuses on physical activity participation patterns across income levels, gender, and racial groups:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The state map ranks states by participation in physical activity (e.g., 150–300 minutes per week).</li>
  <li>Heatmaps show variation across income groups.</li>
  <li>Gender analysis reveals different engagement patterns by physical activity type.</li>
  <li>Racial breakdowns highlight disparities in Z-scores across demographic categories.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Key Insight</strong>: Florida stands out as the most active state, while disparities show that higher-income groups and certain races are more likely to engage in recommended physical activity levels.

</p>

<h3>4) Inactivity Trends Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Inactivity Trends among Adults in the U.S.

<strong>Summary</strong>: This dashboard explores the prevalence of physical inactivity (no leisure activity) across U.S. states and demographic groups:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The U.S. map shows inactivity percentages by state.</li>
  <li>Bar and bubble charts reveal trends based on income, age, and race.</li>
  <li>Z-score comparisons illustrate which states are significantly more or less active than average.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Key Insight</strong>: Older adults (65+), lower-income groups, and racial minorities exhibit higher inactivity levels, making them priority targets for physical activity promotion programs.

</p>

<h3>5) Fruit & Vegetable Consumption Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Fruit & Vegetable Consumption Trends among Adults in the U.S.

<strong>Summary</strong>: This dashboard investigates the prevalence of poor dietary habits, specifically focusing on low fruit and vegetable consumption:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A geographic map shows state-level variation in dietary behaviour.</li>
  <li>A line graph presents national trends over selected years.</li>
  <li>A Z-score bar chart compares average consumption across racial groups.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Key Insight</strong>: The average percentage of adults reporting low consumption is notably high, and certain racial groups (e.g., Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders) show especially low intake, highlighting dietary equity challenges.

<h3>6) Final Insights Dashboard</h3>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Final Insights: Comprehensive Lifestyle Health Trends Across U.S. States and Territories

<strong>Summary</strong>: This conclusive dashboard integrates all three behavioral domains, which includes obesity, physical activity, and nutrition, to provide a comprehensive summary:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The main map shows health indicator Z-scores across states.</li>
  <li>Demographic breakouts visualize how lifestyle factors vary by income, age, race, and sex..</li>
  <li>Time series charts show how scores shift across the 13-year period.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Key Insight</strong>: This unified view reveals that disparities are intersectional with many at-risk groups performing poorly across all three indicators. It also identifies states consistently scoring below the national average (z-score).
